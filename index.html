          <p>Started in 2015 when I was working at The Source, the 'Automated Schedule' was first built to keep track of my constantly changing scheduled hours. It quickly became more than just a schedule tracker as I incorporated features to monitor my earnings and commission. Over the years, it has turned into an essential tool for budgeting and tax referencing.</p>
          <p>The need to manually update the system each week reminded me of the scripting capabilities in Microsoft Excel. Having some background in simple macros, I searched for a similar solution in Google Sheets. This exploration led me to Google Apps Script, a perfect fit since it's based on JavaScript, which I had experience with. Automating the extension of columns, formulas, and color coding led to features like displaying holidays, tracking actual worked hours against the schedule to calculate overtime and discrepancies, and breaking down taxes (for each pay period and total).</p>
          <p>Today, this tool not only displays holidays and manages color coding but also provides a detailed breakdown of taxes and total hours worked each month, helping me keep a precise record of my financials. I continue to use this system almost a decade later, proving its enduring utility and effectiveness."</p>

          <p>I've always been fascinated with the idea of a "smart home" and smart technology. I stumbled across a Google Home Mini sale for $25 each and decided that four was enough coverage for the majority of my apartment. This setup not only provides my preferred background sounds—like instrumental music, smooth jazz, lofi, and natural ambiances such as rain or a fireplace—but also gives my laptop a break.</p>
          <p>My experience with Google Home was limited; I had only temporarily used a Google phone and found its UI and settings too rigid, preferring Samsung instead. Nevertheless, my experiments with a Raspberry Pi piqued my interest in potential integrations. This led to discovering pychromecast, which, despite its occasional inconsistencies in queuing YouTube links, fit well with my programming interests and significantly improved my sleep.</p>
          <p>Encouraged by the initial success, I expanded the system's capabilities to include personal daily assistance. Using the schedule tracking from my Automated Schedule project, I set Google Home to wake me up one hour and thirty minutes before my work start time, remind me to go to bed eight hours before, and give a final reminder thirty minutes before bedtime. Additionally, it provides weather updates and bus schedules each morning, tailored to my daily activities.</p>

        <div class="detailed-description hidden">
          <p>I've always been interested in creating a dedicated server that could remain operational around the clock—hosting FTP, video game servers, bots, movies, and more. While browsing pcpartpicker, I came across an intriguing "incognito" or "sleeper" build, reminiscent of a sleeper car but using an old radio instead of an old beige tower. I bookmarked this innovative idea for future inspiration.</p>
          <p>A few months later, while ordering a replacement motherboard for a friend’s laptop, I received the wrong item: a micro ATX motherboard, unexpectedly perfect for my first home server. It boasted RAID support, onboard graphics, and compatibility with older chipsets. This mistake kicked off my search for an old radio or similar enclosure to house the server. Despite visits to places like Value Village and Goodwill, I found nothing suitable until an accidental discovery at my cousin's house. I found their old Bell satellite receiver/HD PVR box while searching for an ethernet cable. The measurements were perfect, the condition was impeccable—it was an ideal match.</p>
          <p>I built the server inside the Bell box, running it 24/7 for several years now on Windows 10. It hosts a Minecraft server, multiple Discord bots, and continuously streams VLC TV shows for background noise. The performance of the integrated graphics still surprises me given their workload. For assembly, I used three standoffs to mount the motherboard safely and secured everything else with velcro strips—the SSD is attached to the inside top of the case. I added a 3D printed LED holder to the front panel for power and load indicators, and integrated a toggle switch behind the original power button for aesthetic consistency.</p>
          <p>Originally, the only modifications were holes in the bottom and back for the power supply fan and motherboard I/O. Later, I added a hole on the top for a small CPU fan and another in the front panel for a programmable LCD display that shows CPU and RAM usage. It’s almost miraculous how well everything fits together, with just 2mm of clearance above the CPU fan and standoffs.</p>
