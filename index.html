			  <p>I didn‚Äôt initially intend for this to be a project‚Äîhow most of them start.</p>

			  <p>
				One night, my friends and I were drawn back by nostalgia to Garry‚Äôs Mod, into an old gamemode‚Äîa sandbox
				with a player-driven economy‚Äîthat now included a casino my friends had tested as a decent money-maker.
				The only gambling I do with real money is in the stock market.
			  </p>

			  <p>
				While playing blackjack, I noticed that the cards weren‚Äôt just displayed in the 3D worldspace, but were
				also mirrored in the top-right corner of the UI. The cards appeared in the same spot every round.
			  </p>

			  <figure class="media">
				<!-- replace src with your screenshot -->
				<img src="images/placeholders/table-ui.jpg" alt="Blackjack table and UI">
				<figcaption><em>picture of table and UI</em></figcaption>
			  </figure>

			  <p>
				Before my friends even joked that we could automate it, I had already opened Sikuli‚Äîa little known but
				powerful and versatile program developed as a side project at MIT?. I first discovered it over a decade
				ago and have been using it ever since: originally for RuneScape scripts, later for automating simple tasks.
			  </p>

			  <p>
				Consistency made this feasible, which meant I could take advantage of image and pattern recognition.
				I‚Äôve found ways to engineer consistency in 3D games by normalizing the player camera, but this was served
				to me on a platter.
			  </p>

			  <p>The first step was the usual: defining regions on the screen where the program should search for the cards.</p>

			  <figure class="media">
				<!-- replace src with your region comparison -->
				<img src="images/placeholders/card-region-compare.jpg" alt="Card region optimization">
				<figcaption>
				  <em>a trick I learned early on for optimization‚Äîsearch a smaller region of the screen rather than the whole area</em>
				</figcaption>
			  </figure>

			  <p>
				The next step was to identify every card. I figured I‚Äôd start simple with OCR (optical character
				recognition), but it wasn‚Äôt really viable for scalability (detecting suit or color). I thought maybe the
				creator of the casino was lazy and ripped an existing card image pack from somewhere on the internet; I got
				pretty close but couldn‚Äôt find the exact font/style, which would mean manually capturing every. single. 52.
				card. Ugh.
			  </p>

			  <p>So I wrote a script to do it automatically.</p>

			  <p>
				As if the consistent card placement weren‚Äôt convenient enough, the game also accepted keyboard inputs, so
				it was easy to automate the entire game: starting a new round, placing bets, hit/hold/double, and starting
				a new round again. (With random pauses to throw off simple autokey bot detectors.)
			  </p>

			  <p>I implemented the Basic Strategy Chart logic and‚Äîdone!</p>

			  <figure class="media">
				<!-- your chart image -->
				<img src="images/q_values.svg" alt="Basic strategy chart">

			  </figure>

			  <p>
				Almost too easy, right? Wrong. Irony‚Äîbecause it happens every single time. Lulled into a false sense of
				security. Through multiple projects I‚Äôve become well acquainted with edge cases.
			  </p>

			  <p>
				As I was rewarding myself with a coffee, basking in the accomplishment of my ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù project, I came
				back to the computer and noticed other players had joined the blackjack table. No big deal‚Äîuntil I realized
				the dealer‚Äôs cards weren‚Äôt in the same position anymore. Like the smirk sliding off my face, the dealer‚Äôs
				cards slid further down the screen as more players joined. My cards were still at the top, but now other
				players‚Äô hands slotted between mine and the dealer‚Äôs.
			  </p>

			  <p>
				I couldn‚Äôt just leave every time someone else joined, or only play at empty tables‚Äîthat would raise alarm
				bells. Back to the drawing board. But I also realized the potential: more players = a larger sample set
				which meant one thing: I could count cards üí°
			  </p>

			  <p>
				At this point it was too late for me. I was down the rabbit hole of advanced blackjack strategy: Hi-Lo,
				running count, true count, deviations, betting adjustments, etc. I could improve the bot ten-fold.
			  </p>

			  <p>
				But before I could queue up <em>Rain Man</em> on Netflix, I had to solve the roadblock: the bot didn‚Äôt know
				how many players were seated at the table. Without that, this project wasn‚Äôt viable. After analyzing many
				games (and coffees, and walks), I finally caught something: the dealer‚Äôs cards were dealt first. After the
				input to begin the round, I had the bot analyze every possible card region several times per second.
				Depending on which region the dealer‚Äôs cards appeared first, I could deduce how many players were at the
				table with me.
			  </p>

			  <p>
				That worked great, but if I was going to let it run, I didn‚Äôt want to come back to $0 in the bank‚Äîso I
				implemented safeguards. Keep track of bankroll / money spent / gained. Bets dynamically adjusted based on
				bankroll and the counting variables, recalculated every round. Conservative betting, only placing bets if
				EV (expected value) is positive. Handle edge cases: if the running count changed significantly (trying to
				detect reshuffles), reset the estimated decks. Only increase min bet after a 50-round threshold.
			  </p>

			  <p>
				Paranoid about possible anti-card-counting techniques, I added a custom streak counter: if I‚Äôd won too many
				times in a row and the variables hadn‚Äôt changed much, dial the betting back a bit. I researched things like
				the ‚ÄúRule of Three‚Äù (if a certain event did not occur in a sample of <em>n</em> subjects, assume that the
				event has happened) ‚Üí e.g., if a dealer is using 6 decks and we‚Äôve seen 312 cards, assume the deck has been
				shuffled at least once.
			  </p>

			  <p>
				The more research I did, the more I realized I needed to figure out how the blackjack game was programmed.
				Implementing the advanced strategy seemed to work less well than just using the basic strategy.
			  </p>

			  <p>
				Until I stumbled across a research paper from Stanford from 2019. It was like a hand extending from the
				heavens. Trial and error didn‚Äôt seem to be making much progress‚Äîunclear logic, unknown ruleset (how many
				decks, infinite decks, reshuffling, anti-counting measures?), and I couldn‚Äôt simulate at scale because each
				round took ~10 seconds. So I looked for blackjack ML papers and found one that matched my constraints
				closely (even aces low).
			  </p>

			  <p>
				I implemented a super-rudimentary online learner: the script logs every single turn to JSON (dealer total,
				rank-based deltas, running count, true count, player total). It maintains Q-values for actions (hit/stand,
				etc.). When a Q-value is confident enough, it makes that decision; otherwise it falls back to the
				non-ML strategy. After each outcome, it updates the Q-value and iterates.

          <p>Placeholder slop: Started in 2015 when I was working at The Source, the 'Automated Schedule' was first built to keep track of my constantly changing scheduled hours. It quickly became more than just a schedule tracker as I incorporated features to monitor my earnings and commission. Over the years, it has turned into an essential tool for budgeting and tax referencing.</p>
          <p>The need to manually update the system each week reminded me of the scripting capabilities in Microsoft Excel. Having some background in simple macros, I searched for a similar solution in Google Sheets. This exploration led me to Google Apps Script, a perfect fit since it's based on JavaScript, which I had experience with. Automating the extension of columns, formulas, and color coding led to features like displaying holidays, tracking actual worked hours against the schedule to calculate overtime and discrepancies, and breaking down taxes (for each pay period and total).</p>
          <p>Today, this tool not only displays holidays and manages color coding but also provides a detailed breakdown of taxes and total hours worked each month, helping me keep a precise record of my financials. I continue to use this system almost a decade later, proving its enduring utility and effectiveness."</p>

          <p>Placeholder slop: I've always been fascinated with the idea of a "smart home" and smart technology. I stumbled across a Google Home Mini sale for $25 each and decided that four was enough coverage for the majority of my apartment. This setup not only provides my preferred background sounds‚Äîlike instrumental music, smooth jazz, lofi, and natural ambiances such as rain or a fireplace‚Äîbut also gives my laptop a break.</p>
          <p>My experience with Google Home was limited; I had only temporarily used a Google phone and found its UI and settings too rigid, preferring Samsung instead. Nevertheless, my experiments with a Raspberry Pi piqued my interest in potential integrations. This led to discovering pychromecast, which, despite its occasional inconsistencies in queuing YouTube links, fit well with my programming interests and significantly improved my sleep.</p>
          <p>Encouraged by the initial success, I expanded the system's capabilities to include personal daily assistance. Using the schedule tracking from my Automated Schedule project, I set Google Home to wake me up one hour and thirty minutes before my work start time, remind me to go to bed eight hours before, and give a final reminder thirty minutes before bedtime. Additionally, it provides weather updates and bus schedules each morning, tailored to my daily activities.</p>

        <div class="detailed-description hidden">
          <p>Placeholder slop: I've always been interested in creating a dedicated server that could remain operational around the clock‚Äîhosting FTP, video game servers, bots, movies, and more. While browsing pcpartpicker, I came across an intriguing "incognito" or "sleeper" build, reminiscent of a sleeper car but using an old radio instead of an old beige tower. I bookmarked this innovative idea for future inspiration.</p>
          <p>A few months later, while ordering a replacement motherboard for a friend‚Äôs laptop, I received the wrong item: a micro ATX motherboard, unexpectedly perfect for my first home server. It boasted RAID support, onboard graphics, and compatibility with older chipsets. This mistake kicked off my search for an old radio or similar enclosure to house the server. Despite visits to places like Value Village and Goodwill, I found nothing suitable until an accidental discovery at my cousin's house. I found their old Bell satellite receiver/HD PVR box while searching for an ethernet cable. The measurements were perfect, the condition was impeccable‚Äîit was an ideal match.</p>
          <p>I built the server inside the Bell box, running it 24/7 for several years now on Windows 10. It hosts a Minecraft server, multiple Discord bots, and continuously streams VLC TV shows for background noise. The performance of the integrated graphics still surprises me given their workload. For assembly, I used three standoffs to mount the motherboard safely and secured everything else with velcro strips‚Äîthe SSD is attached to the inside top of the case. I added a 3D printed LED holder to the front panel for power and load indicators, and integrated a toggle switch behind the original power button for aesthetic consistency.</p>
          <p>Originally, the only modifications were holes in the bottom and back for the power supply fan and motherboard I/O. Later, I added a hole on the top for a small CPU fan and another in the front panel for a programmable LCD display that shows CPU and RAM usage. It‚Äôs almost miraculous how well everything fits together, with just 2mm of clearance above the CPU fan and standoffs.</p>
